# Basic_Onshape_CAD

This is my repo for my caster project, and possibly other basic CAD assignments.

## Parts

### Base

The base of my caster was a fairly simple process. I learned a few keyboard shortcuts and some basics on how Onshape works as opposed to Solidworks. I extruded a rectangle and cut circles (created with a linear pattern) out of it. The finished base is picured below.

### Mount

Similarly, the mount for my caster was a simple process of extruding a sketch, but this time, with holes already built into the extrusion. Once again, I used a linear pattern for the holes. The mount is pictured below.

### Fork

The fork was slightly more complex, but still fairly easy. I extruded a thin disc, then extruded two legs out from it on one side and a cylinder out from the other. I then extruded a hole through the legs. Finally, I added fillets and chamfers throughout the part to streamline it. Here's the full part.

### Tire

The tire was a simple part, but introduced me to some new tools. First, I made a rough trapezoid with the line tool, then added vertical and horizontal construction lines. I then defined the trapezoid's dimensions and set it to be symmetrical about the vertical construction line. I then revolved the trapezoid 360 degrees and made the tire dark grey. With that, it was complete, and appeared as below.

### Wheel

The wheel of my caster was somewhat more complex. I used a revolve again, then made a cut-out through a nice feature of Onshape: you can select certain parts of a sketch to use in a feature. Because of that, sketching the cut-out was far quicker. I used a circular pattern to create 5 more cut-outs, then added a few fillets.

### Axle & Collar

Making the axle was a simple extruded cylinder and a cut. The cut used used some of the cylinder's geometry through the *Use* tool. Next, I made a collar for the axle. This was also a simple extrusion, but used an exciting feature of Onshape: it created an entirely new part *inside* the same document that held the axle.

### Washer

The washer was one of the simplest parts. It was just an extrusion of a cylinder. However, it is still useful in the final assembly, and thus deserves a section of its own.

## Assembly

### Wheel + Axle Subassembly

Before making a full assembly of the entire caster, I first made a smaller subassembly of just the wheel, tire, axle, and 2 bearings (a new part which was incredibly simple). I learned how to use mates in Onshape. I think the mate interface is weird and miss Solidworks, but I'm sure I'll get used to it reasonably soon. I mated the tire onto the wheel, the axle into the wheel, and the bearings onto each side of the axle.

### Final Assembly

I was finally ready to put it all together. It was a long process, as I had to use my new (and still questionable) mating skills a lot. In terms of *new* skills, however, I only learned one: how to import parts from a pre-made library. This library is for things like screws, bolts, and other standardized products. After figuring that out, it was a simple matter of fiddling with mates until I was happy with it. The final, completed caster wheel is pictured below, alongside a link to its Onshape document.
