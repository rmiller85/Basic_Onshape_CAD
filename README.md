# Basic_Onshape_CAD

This is my repo for my caster project, and possibly other basic CAD assignments.

### Base

The base of my caster was a fairly simple process. I learned a few keyboard shortcuts and some basics on how Onshape works as opposed to Solidworks. I extruded a rectangle and cut circles (created with a linear pattern) out of it. The finished base is picured below.

### Mount

Similarly, the mount for my caster was a simple process of extruding a sketch, but this time, with holes already built into the extrusion. Once again, I used a linear pattern for the holes. The mount is pictured below.
